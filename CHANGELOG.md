## [Unreleased]

### Added — operational GoDaddy, IONOS, and Joker provider adapters

- `donazopy providers` (and `status`, target notation, every command) now exposes four operational providers: `cloudflare`, `godaddy`, `ionos`, `joker`.
- `src/donazopy/providers/godaddy.py`: real `GoDaddyProvider` adapter over the GoDaddy API (`api.godaddy.com/v1`, `Authorization: sso-key {key}:{secret}`). Implements `list_zones` (`GET /domains`), `list_records` / `export_zone` (`GET /domains/{d}/records`, folding GoDaddy's separate `MX`/`SRV` priority/weight/port fields back into BIND rdata, synthesizing a SOA since GoDaddy's SOA carries only the primary nameserver), `import_zone` (`PATCH /domains/{d}/records`, never re-sends the GoDaddy-managed SOA), `delete_all_records` (`DELETE /domains/{d}/records/{type}/{name}` per group, keeping apex NS/SOA), `read_nameservers` (`GET /domains/{d}` → `nameServers`), and a real `assign_nameservers` (`PUT /domains/{d}` with `{"nameServers": [...]}`). Credentials: `GODADDY_API_KEY`, `GODADDY_API_SECRET`.
- `src/donazopy/providers/ionos.py`: real `IonosProvider` adapter over the IONOS DNS API (`api.hosting.ionos.com/dns/v1`, `X-API-Key: {public}.{secret}`). Implements `list_zones`, `list_records`, `export_zone` (BIND text), `import_zone` (POSTs records, never re-sends the IONOS-managed SOA), `delete_all_records`, `read_nameservers` (apex NS records). `assign_nameservers` raises a clear "not supported" error because the IONOS DNS API cannot change registrar delegation. Credentials: `IONOS_API_PUBLIC`, `IONOS_API_SECRET`.
- `src/donazopy/providers/joker.py`: real `JokerProvider` adapter over the Joker.com DMAPI (`https://dmapi.joker.com/request/`). Opens a session via `login` with `JOKER_API_KEY` → `Auth-Sid`, then implements `list_zones` (`query-domain-list`), `list_records` / `export_zone` / `import_zone` / `delete_all_records` (`dns-zone-get` / `dns-zone-put`, converting between Joker's `<label> <type> <pri> <target> <ttl>` line format and BIND, synthesizing a placeholder SOA on export since Joker manages it), `read_nameservers` (apex NS), and `assign_nameservers` (`domain-modify` with `ns-list`). Credentials: `JOKER_API_KEY` (replaces the previous `JOKER_USERNAME` / `JOKER_PASSWORD` stub).
- `src/donazopy/zonefile.py`: added `build_bind_zone(origin, records, *, default_ttl, synthetic_nameserver)` — constructs parseable BIND zone text from generic provider record mappings (handles `MX`/`SRV` priority folding, TXT quoting, FQDN normalization for `CNAME`/`NS`/`PTR`/`DNAME`, SOA mname/rname dotting, treats a partial/short SOA as absent, and synthesizes a missing SOA and/or apex NS so the output always round-trips through `parse_zone_text`).
- `src/donazopy/providers/registry.py`: `GoDaddyProvider`, `IonosProvider`, and `JokerProvider` registered as operational; `create_dns_provider` / `create_registrar_provider` resolve all four providers via a shared `_PROVIDER_FACTORIES` table.
- Tests: `tests/test_godaddy_provider.py`, `tests/test_ionos_provider.py`, `tests/test_joker_provider.py` (mocked `httpx.MockTransport` coverage of every adapter method, error paths, and BIND round-trips); updated `tests/test_registry.py` and `tests/test_cli.py` for the four-provider list.
- Docs: `src_docs/md/providers.md` and `src_docs/md/architecture.md` updated (new operational-provider sections, planned-table trimmed) and the `docs/` site rebuilt; `README.md` provider matrix and credentials section updated.

### Added — `domains` command and bulk nameserver reads

- `donazopy domains PROVIDER` lists the domains/zones a provider manages. `PROVIDER` may be a provider key (`ionos`) or a target with a wildcard domain (`ionos/*`).
- `donazopy nameservers PROVIDER/*` now reads nameservers for every domain the provider manages and returns a `{domain: [nameserver, ...]}` map (previously a wildcard domain errored). Assigning nameservers still requires a single concrete domain.
- The "target must name a single domain" error now points users at `donazopy domains <provider>`.

### Added — zone creation (`create-zone`, `copy --create`)

- `DNSHostingProvider` Protocol gained `create_zone(domain)` (idempotent where supported; `ProviderAPIError` otherwise).
- `CloudflareProvider.create_zone(domain)` → `POST /zones` (idempotent: returns the existing zone on the "already exists" / code 1061 error). The Cloudflare account is taken from `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` when set, otherwise auto-detected via `GET /accounts` when the token spans exactly one account; `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is a new *optional* environment variable.
- `IonosProvider`, `GoDaddyProvider`, `JokerProvider` `create_zone` raise a clear "not supported" error — those providers create the DNS zone implicitly with the domain registration.
- New `donazopy create-zone TARGET` command.
- `donazopy copy SOURCE DEST` now creates the destination zone first when it is missing and the provider supports it (default `--create=True`; pass `--create=False` to skip). Destinations whose DNS zone exists implicitly with the domain registration are tolerated — the create step is skipped, not an error. The `copy` result now includes a `"created"` entry alongside `"replaced"`. Cloudflare's `create_zone` checks for the existing zone first, so `copy` between existing Cloudflare zones does not need account-level token permissions.

### Added (issue 203 — unified target notation, CLI restructure, docs site)

#### Unified target notation (`src/donazopy/target.py`)
- Added new module `src/donazopy/target.py` implementing `parse_target`, `resolve_provider_key`, `looks_like_path`, and the frozen `Target` dataclass.
- Target notation: `[provider/][domain][:record_type][:host_name][:value]`. Each segment defaults to "no filter"; `*` is also accepted as an explicit wildcard.
- `example.com` resolves to whichever sole operational provider manages it; if there are multiple, the command errors and asks for an explicit `provider/` prefix.
- `cloudflare/example.com` (and `:*:*:*` variants) selects that domain on that provider.
- `cloudflare/*` selects all domains on the provider.
- Trailing `:TYPE:host:value` segments are record-level filters; `*` means no filter on that field.
- `looks_like_path` distinguishes local zone-file paths from provider targets by extension, prefix, and path-separator heuristics.

#### Simplified and renamed CLI command set
- Added `donazopy status [TARGET] [--dotenv-path]` (replaces `provider` and `provider-status`).
- Added `donazopy records TARGET [--dotenv-path]` (replaces `provider-records`).
- Added `donazopy export TARGET [--output] [--overwrite] [--skip-ns] [--skip-types] [--dotenv-path]` (replaces `provider-export-zone`).
- Added `donazopy import-zone TARGET PATH [--proxied] [--dotenv-path]` (replaces `provider-import-zone`).
- Added `donazopy nameservers TARGET [NS...] [--dotenv-path]` (replaces `provider-nameservers`; now also accepts new nameservers as positional args to assign them).
- Added `donazopy diff A B [--origin] [--dotenv-path]` (replaces `zone-diff`; each side may be a local zone-file path or a provider target).
- Added `donazopy validate PATH [--origin]` (replaces `validate-zone`).
- Added `donazopy normalize PATH [--origin] [--output] [--overwrite]` (replaces `zone-normalize` / `zone-dump`).
- Added `donazopy copy SOURCE DEST [--skip-ns] [--skip-types] [--replace] [--dotenv-path]` — new command, copies a zone from one provider target to another, with optional `--skip-ns` / `--skip-types` filtering and `--replace` to wipe destination records first.

#### Export / copy filtering
- `export` and `copy` both accept `--skip-ns` (drop NS records) and `--skip-types=A,AAAA,...` (drop a comma-separated list of record types).
- `copy --replace` calls `delete_all_records` on the destination domain before importing.

#### Cloudflare provider additions
- Added `list_zones` to enumerate all zones on the account.
- Added `delete_all_records(domain)` used by `copy --replace` to wipe destination records.
- Added `assign_nameservers(domain, nameservers)` — raises a clear "not supported" error because the Cloudflare DNS API cannot set registrar delegation; documented as a placeholder for registrar-capable providers.

#### Zone-file helpers
- Added `filter_zone_text(text, origin, skip_ns, skip_types)` to drop NS or given-type records from raw BIND text.
- Added `filter_records(records, skip_ns, skip_types)` for record-list filtering.
- Added `records_from_zone_text(text, origin)` for in-memory zone parsing without a file.

#### Documentation site
- Added ProtoDocs (`properdocs`) + MaterialX (`mkdocs-materialx`) documentation site.
- Source pages in `src_docs/md/`: index, installation, quickstart, cli, targets, providers, zonefiles, architecture, contributing, changelog.
- MkDocs config at `mkdocs/mkdocs.yml`.
- Pre-built static output committed to `docs/`.
- Build and serve via `./docs.sh build` / `./docs.sh serve`.
- Docs dependencies added to `pyproject.toml` under `[dependency-groups] docs`.

### Changed (issue 203)
- CLI is now a single unified `Donazopy` Fire class; all commands use the target notation instead of separate provider/zone command namespaces.
- `diff` now accepts provider targets as well as local zone file paths on either side.
- README rewritten to document the new command surface, target notation, and documentation site.

### Removed (issue 203 — clean break from old command names)
- Removed `provider` (show provider info) — replaced by `status`.
- Removed `provider-status` — replaced by `status`.
- Removed `provider-records` — replaced by `records`.
- Removed `provider-export-zone` — replaced by `export`.
- Removed `provider-import-zone` — replaced by `import-zone`.
- Removed `provider-nameservers` — replaced by `nameservers`.
- Removed `validate-zone` — replaced by `validate`.
- Removed `zone-normalize` / `zone-dump` — replaced by `normalize`.
- Removed `zone-diff` — replaced by `diff`.

### Added (earlier work)
- Added the initial Hatch/uv Python package scaffold for `donazopy`.
- Added Fire-based CLI entry points for version, provider listing, provider information, and zone validation.
- Added Fire-based CLI entry points for zone normalization, zone dump output, and zone diff planning.
- Added `python-dotenv` support for provider credential loading from discovered or explicit `.env` files, with real environment variables taking precedence.
- Added redacted provider credential status output that reports presence and source without printing secret values.
- Added operational Cloudflare DNS support for record listing, BIND zone export, BIND zone import, and assigned nameserver reads.
- Added zone-file parsing, validation, normalization, deterministic dump, safe output writing, and before/after diff helpers built on `dnspython`.
- Added the 12-chapter project specification under `spec/`.
- Added the implementation task list in `TODO.md`.
- Added build and publish scripts matching the project brief.
- Added Pyright configuration and tests for package metadata, operational provider registry behavior, CLI metadata, zone validation, zone normalization, zone diffing, dotenv credential redaction, and Cloudflare API operations with mocked HTTP.

### Changed (earlier work)
- Limited the runtime provider registry to functional operational providers only; Cloudflare is currently the only exposed provider.
- Expanded the README into a focused user/developer guide covering dotenv credentials, local zone commands, Cloudflare operations, safety behavior, and the functional provider matrix.
- Corrected package metadata to use the Apache Software License classifier, matching `LICENSE`.
- Moved verified-solved setup, zone-engine, dotenv credential-loading, Cloudflare-provider, and documentation tasks out of `TODO.md` so it only tracks remaining work.

### Removed (earlier work)
- Removed provider dry-run plan and adapter-stub surfaces that advertised behavior without performing real provider operations.
- Removed nonfunctional providers from the runtime provider list until they have real adapters and tests.
